### Hello everyone! 👋

:round_pushpin: I'm Axel, I was born in US, Washington D.C. but I'm a Barcelona based programmer, :smile: living here in Spain since I was little.

:floppy_disk: I write code because it is a **creative and logic super-power**. With code you can build **anything**! ✨:heart_eyes:    :bug:

:heartpulse: If you like some of my repositories please give them stars, it will make me very happy! ありがとうございました! :star::star:

:tokyo_tower: I also like japan! :jp: 日本はすごいです! But this is not the right place to write in Japanese right? :laughing:
